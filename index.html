                    Unlike the band's two previous albums (Discovery and Xanadu), written under the influence of pop and disco styles, Time refers to the Electric Light Orchestra's favorite style - progressive rock [source not specified 1686 days]. His songs tell the story of a man who got into the year 2095 and is unable to return home.

                    The reviewer of Classic Rock magazine noted that, despite the promises of a "heavier sound" and futuristic song titles, Lynn was inspired by the 1960s (drawing parallels with Roy Orbison and Buddy Holly).

                A penny in your pocket <br>
Suitcase in your hand <br>
They won't get you very far <br>
Now you're a 21st century man.<br>
Fly across the city <br>
Rise above the land <br>
You can do 'most anything <br>
Now you're a 21st century man.<br>
Though you ride on the wheels of tomorrow<br>
You still wander the fields of your sorrow<br>
One day you're a hero <br>
Next day you're a clown <br>
There's nothing that is in between <br>
Now you're a 21st century man.<br>
You should be so happy <br>
You should be so glad <br>
So why are you so lonely <br>
You 21st century man<br>
You stepped out of a dream believing <br>
Everything was gone <br>
Return with what you've learned <br>
They'll kiss the ground you walk upon.<br>
Things ain't how you thought they were <br>
Nothing have you planned <br>
So pick up your penny and your suitcase <br>
You're not a 21st century man.<br>
Though you ride on the wheels of tomorrow <br>
You still wander the fields of your sorrow <br>
21st century man<br>

    The Electric Light Orchestra (ELO) are an English rock band formed in Birmingham in 1970 by songwriters and multi-instrumentalists Jeff Lynne and Roy Wood with drummer Bev Bevan. Their music is characterised by a fusion of Beatlesque pop, classical arrangements and futuristic iconography. After Wood's departure in 1972, Lynne became the band's sole leader, arranging and producing every album while writing nearly all of their original material. For their initial tenure, Lynne, Bevan and keyboardist Richard Tandy were the group's only consistent members.
</div>
<div class="another-text-middle">
    ELO was formed out of Lynne's and Wood's desire to create modern rock and pop songs with classical overtones. It derived as an offshoot of Wood's previous band, the Move, of which Lynne and Bevan were also members. During the 1970s and 1980s, ELO released a string of top 10 albums and singles, including two LPs that reached the top of British charts: the disco-inspired Discovery (1979) and the science-fiction-themed concept album Time (1981). In 1986 Lynne lost interest in the band and disbanded the group. Bevan responded by forming his own band, ELO Part II, which later became the Orchestra. Apart from a brief reunion in the early 2000s, ELO remained largely inactive until 2014, when Lynne re-formed the band again with Tandy as Jeff Lynne's ELO.

    <div class="another-text-bottom">
    During ELO's original 13-year period of active recording and touring, they sold over 50 million records worldwide, and collected 19 CRIA, 21 RIAA, and 38 BPI awards. From 1972 to 1986, ELO accumulated 27 top 40 songs on the UK Singles Chart, and fifteen top 20 songs on the US Billboard Hot 100. The band also holds the record for having the most Billboard Hot 100 top 40 hits (20) without a number one single of any band in US chart history. In 2017, the key members of ELO (Wood, Lynne, Bevan and Tandy) were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

        In 1968, Roy Wood - guitarist, vocalist and songwriter of the Move - had the idea to form a new band that would use violins, cellos, string basses, French horns and woodwinds to give his music a classic sound, directing rock music in the direction of "catching that atles is stopped". The focus will be on orchestral instruments, not guitars. Jeff Lynn, the frontman of the Birmingham band The Idle Race, was delighted with this concept. When Trevor Burton left Move in February 1969, Wood asked Lynn to join, only to say no as he was still focused on achieving success with his band. But in January 1970, when Carl Wayne left the band, Lynn accepted Wood's second invitation to join, on the condition that they focus their energy on a new project.

       <div class="addition-second">
        On July 12, 1970, when Wood added some cellos to a song written by Lynn that was supposed to be the B-side of the movement, the new concept became a reality, and "10538 Overture" became the Electric Light Orchestra's first song. The original plan was to end The Move after the release of the album Looking On in late 1970, moving to a new division in the new year, but to help fund the young band, another Move album Message from the Country was also recorded during the lengthy ELO recordings and released in mid-1971. As a result, The Electric Light Orchestra's debut album was released in December 1971. In all the songs, only the trio of Wood, Lynn and Bevan played, with Bill Hunt playing the French horn and Steve Woolham playing the violin. It was released in the US in March 1972 as "No Answer". The name was chosen after the record company secretary tried to call the British company to find out the name of the album. They were unavailable, so she left a "No answer" note. "10538 Overture" entered the top ten in the UK. Both albums of the band appeared in stores at the same time, and Move and ELO appeared on television during this period.

        ELO's debut concert took place on April 16, 1972 at the Greyhound Pub in Croydon, Surrey, consisting of: Wood, Lynn, Bevan, Bill Hunt (keyboards / French horn). , Andy Craig (cello), Mike Edwards (cello), Wilfred Gibson (violin), Hugh McDowell (cello) and Richard Tandy (bass). However, such a composition did not last long. First Craig left, and then Wood left during the recording of the band's second LP. Taking Hunt and McDowell with him, Wood left the band to form Wizzard. Both cited problems with their manager, Don Arden, whom Wood considered unsuccessful in his role, as well as an unsatisfactory tour of Italy, where cellos and violins could not be heard over electric instruments. However, Arden will run Wizzard, despite Wood's negative comments to Arden. Despite the predictions of the music press that the band would break up without Wood, who was the driving force behind the creation of ELO, Lynn began to lead the band with Bevan, Edwards, Gibson and Tandy (who switched from bass to keyboards. instead of Hunt), left over from the previous line-up, and new recruits Mike de Albuquerque and Colin Walker join the band playing bass and cello respectively.

       <div class="addition-forth">
        The new line-up performed at the Reading Festival 1972 on August 12, 1972. The Barcus Berry instrument pickups now worn by the band's string trios allowed them to get proper amplification on stage for their instruments, which had previously been almost drowned out by electrified instruments. The band released their second album ELO 2 in early 1973, which produced their second top ten in the UK and first single on the US charts, an elaborate version of the Chuck Berry classic "Roll Over Beethoven" (which also included the first movement of Beethoven's own Fifth Symphony). ELO also made their first appearance on American Bandstand . During the recording of the third album, Gibson was fired due to a dispute over money, Mick Kaminsky joined as a violinist, and Walker left because touring kept him away from his family too much. The remaining cellist Edwards finished the cello parts for the album. The resulting album On the Third Day was released in late 1973 with an American version of the popular single "Showdown". After leaving Wizzard, Hugh McDowell returned as the band's second cellist, also in late 1973.
